## **Day 32: The Merging Minds – Sorted Merge Challenge** 📊✨

### **📜 Story**  
Your next challenge on the Mysterious Island is to merge two sorted arrays into one perfectly sorted sequence.  
Echo says,  
*"Look, every team member plays their part. Now, you must merge two separate arrays into one unified team to uncover the secrets of the multiverse!"*  

No jokes from Nariyal Bhai or Mayur today—just your focus and dedication are needed.  

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes two sorted arrays as input** (each array provided as space-separated integers).  
2. **Merges the two arrays into one sorted array.**  
3. **Prints the merged sorted array.**

*Note:*  
- The arrays are already sorted in ascending order.  
- Maintain the overall sorted order in the merged array.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter first sorted array: 1 3 5 7  
Enter second sorted array: 2 4 6 8  
```  
**Output:**  
```
Merged Sorted Array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter first sorted array: 10 20 30  
Enter second sorted array: 5 15 25 35  
```  
**Output:**  
```
Merged Sorted Array: 5 10 15 20 25 30 35  
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Two-pointer Technique:** Use two pointers, one for each array, and compare elements to build the merged array.  
- **Built-in Methods:** Some languages allow concatenating and sorting, but try manual merging for practice.

## **Day 33: The Linked List Labyrinth – Chain Reaction!**  

### **📜 Story**  
You’re in a small cave on the Mysterious Island, facing a maze of linked lists.  
Echo says,  
*"This linked list is like a chain reaction. Each node connects to the next. Your task is to link these nodes in the right sequence and print them!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Build and Print a Linked List**  
Write a program that:  
1. Takes integers as input and creates a linked list.  
2. Traverses and prints the list in order.  

**Example:**  
Input: `10 20 30 40` → Output: `Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40`

## **Day 34: The Queue Conundrum – Order in Chaos!**  

### **📜 Story**  
You’re in a room where everything is randomly arranged.  
Echo says,  
*"Understand the magic of queues—first in, first out. Implement a queue to handle processes orderly!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Implement a Queue**  
1. Enqueue integers, then dequeue a specified number.  
2. Print the remaining queue.  

**Example:**  
Input: Enqueue `10 20 30 40`, Dequeue `2` → Output: `Remaining Queue: 30 40`

## **Day 35: The Stack of Secrets – Push & Pop!**  

### **📜 Story**  
Like college assignments, everything has an order. Implement a stack to store and retrieve secret codes!  
Echo says,  
*"Stack is last in, first out. Push and pop to uncover secrets!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Implement a Stack**  
1. Push integers, then pop a specified number.  
2. Print the stack’s current state.  

**Example:**  
Input: Push `100 200 300`, Pop `1` → Output: `Current Stack: 100 200`

## **Day 36: The Hash Map Heist – Key-Value Magic!**  

### **📜 Story**  
Unlock a vault where items are stored as key-value pairs.  
Echo says,  
*"Use hash maps to count word frequencies—a shortcut to multiverse clues!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Word Frequency Counter**  
1. Input a sentence, count word frequencies using a hash map.  
2. Print each word with its count.  

**Example:**  
Input: `"The Glitch is everywhere"` → Output: `the: 1, glitch: 1, is: 1, everywhere: 1`

## **Day 37: The Binary Tree Challenge – Traversal Techniques**  

### **📜 Story**  
You’re in an ancient grove with a magical binary tree.  
Echo says,  
*"Use tree traversals to explore every branch. In-order traversal reveals its structure!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: In-Order Traversal**  
1. Construct a binary tree from given nodes.  
2. Perform in-order traversal (left, root, right).  

**Example:**  
Input: `10 5 15` → Output: `5 10 15`

## **Day 38: The Graph Maze – BFS Explorer!**  

### **📜 Story**  
Navigate a maze of tangled paths using Breadth-First Search (BFS).  
Echo says,  
*"BFS is the best way to reach every corner of the maze!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Implement BFS**  
1. Represent a graph as an adjacency list.  
2. Traverse from a starting node using BFS.  

**Example:**  
Input: Graph `A: B, C`, Start at `A` → Output: `A B C`

## **Day 39: The Quick Sort Quest – Sorting Under Pressure!**  

### **📜 Story**  
On a battlefield, numbers are out of order. Restore order with Quick Sort!  
Echo says,  
*"Quick Sort will help you control the chaos before The Glitch strikes!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Implement Quick Sort**  
1. Take an unsorted array, sort it using Quick Sort.  
2. Print the sorted array.  

**Example:**  
Input: `34 7 23` → Output: `7 23 34`

## **Day 40: The Dynamic Programming Dilemma – Optimized Decisions!**  

### **📜 Story**  
In an advanced lab, solve problems using dynamic programming (DP).  
Echo says,  
*"Break problems into subproblems—like the 0/1 Knapsack or Fibonacci with DP!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Solve a DP Problem**  
Choose:  
- **0/1 Knapsack**: Maximize value without exceeding weight capacity.  
- **Fibonacci with Memoization**: Optimize recursive Fibonacci calculations.  

**Example (Fibonacci):**  
Input: `n = 5` → Output: `5`
