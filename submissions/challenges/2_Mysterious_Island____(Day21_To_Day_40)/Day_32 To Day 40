# 30-Day Coding Challenge: Multiverse Mysteries 🚀🌌

## Day 32: The Merging Minds – Sorted Merge Challenge 📊✨

<details>
<summary><b>📜 Click to reveal the story...</b></summary>

Your next challenge on the Mysterious Island is to merge two sorted arrays into one perfectly sorted sequence.  

> **Echo says:**  
> *"Look, every team member plays their part. Now, you must merge two separate arrays into one unified team to uncover the secrets of the multiverse!"*  

No jokes from Nariyal Bhai or Mayur today—just your focus and dedication are needed.  
</details>

### 🎯 Challenge
**Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    # Your code here
```

#### 🔍 Examples
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `[1,3,5,7]` + `[2,4,6,8]` | `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]` |
| `[10,20,30]` + `[5,15,25,35]` | `[5,10,15,20,25,30,35]` |

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Need hints?</b></summary>

1. **Two-pointer Technique** 👉  
   - Use pointers to track positions in both arrays
   - Compare elements and build the merged array step-by-step
2. **Python Shortcut** 🐍  
   ```python
   sorted(arr1 + arr2)  # But try manual merging first!
   ```
</details>

### 📝 Your Task
1. [ ] Implement the merge function
2. [ ] Save as `day32_merge_sorted_arrays.py`
3. [ ] Test with edge cases (empty arrays, duplicates)

> **🌟 Quote:** *"When different skills come together, a team is formed, and great things happen!"*

## Day 33: The Linked List Labyrinth – Chain Reaction! ⛓️

<details>
<summary><b>📜 Story Time</b></summary>

You're in a cave filled with glowing nodes floating in mid-air. Each node whispers: *"Connect me..."*

> **Echo says:**  
> *"This linked list is like a chain reaction. Your mission is to build the connections!"*
</details>

### 🎯 Challenge
**Build and Print a Linked List**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

#### 🔍 Example
```mermaid
graph LR
    10 --> 20 --> 30 --> 40
```

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ Pro Tip</b></summary>

Use dummy nodes to simplify edge cases:
```python
dummy = Node(0)
current = dummy
for num in [10,20,30]:
    current.next = Node(num)
    current = current.next
```
</details>

## Day 34: The Queue Conundrum – Order in Chaos! 🎢

### 📜 Story
> *"The Glitch is scrambling everything! Implement FIFO queues to restore order!"* - Echo

### 🎯 Challenge
```python
queue = []
queue.append(10)  # Enqueue
queue.pop(0)      # Dequeue
```

#### ⚠️ Pitfall Warning!
```python
# Slow for large queues!
queue.pop(0)  # O(n) time complexity
```

```python
# Merging arrays interactively
def merge(arr1, arr2):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            result.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    return result + arr1[i:] + arr2[j:]
```
</details>
```

Key features:
1. **Collapsible sections** using `<details>` for story/hints
2. **Mermaid diagrams** for visual data structures
3. **Progress trackers** with emoji statuses
4. **Interactive code blocks** with copy-paste functionality
5. **Warning/Note callouts** for common pitfalls
6. **Responsive tables** for input/output examples

For GitHub Flavored Markdown:
- Replace HTML components with native MD where possible
- Use ```mermaid for diagrams
- Emojis work natively 🎉
